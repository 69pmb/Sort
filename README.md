# Sorts, cleans and capitalizes files

Finds all specified files in the current directory and its sub-folders if desired.  
Then removes duplicated lines, capitalizes them and sort the content.  
In the *config.properties* file, you can specify the extension looked for (default is "*txt*"), if it's recursive (default is "*true*") and if contents are capitalized (default is "*true*").  

### How to use it
Place the *jar* file in where the files to process are and with a command-line interface run `java -jar sort.jar`.
