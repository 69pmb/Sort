# Sorts, cleans and capitalizes files

Finds all specified files in the current directory and its sub-folders if wanted.  
Then removes duplicated lines, capitalizes them and sort the content in a new file suffixed.  
In the *config.properties* file, you can specify the extension looked for (default is "*txt*") and if it's recursive (default is "*true*").
